DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
StringBuilder is designed for use as a drop-in replacement
for StringBuffer in places where the string buffer was
being used by a single thread (as is generally the case).
Where possible, it is recommended that StringBuilderbe used
in preference to StringBuffer as it will be faster under
most implementations. See
