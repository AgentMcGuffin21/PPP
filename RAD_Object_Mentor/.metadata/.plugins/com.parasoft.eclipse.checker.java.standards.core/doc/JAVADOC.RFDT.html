Follow the required format for '@deprecated' tags [JAVADOC.RFDT-3]
</STRONG>
<BR><BR>

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule checks that all '@deprecated' tags have a value that is 
properly formatted.  An example of a properly formatted '@deprecated'
tag is

@deprecated AsOf: 10/10/2006 Version: 6.4.1.0606_DEV Reason: Some reason 
blah blah Substitute: Some substitute blah blah

'@deprecated' tags should have, in order, sections labelled "AsOf:", 
"Version:", "Reason:", and "Substitute:".  If any one of these labels 
is missing from a '@deprecated' tag, if one of the labels is spelled 
incorrectly, or if the sections are out of order, this rule will flag a 
violation.  

The rule also checks that none of the sections of the '@deprecated' 
tag are empty and that the date in the "AsOf:" section matches the 
correct format.  The date should match the following format: MM/DD/YYYY.
The month should be a number between 01 and 12.  The date should start
with a number between 0 and 3.  The year should start with either "19"
or "20".  There are no specific requirements for the other sections, 
but they must not be empty.  

The rule will flag any '@deprecated' tag where the value of the tag does 
not match the regular expression "AsOf: [0-1]?[0-9]/[0-3]?[0-9]/[1-2][90]
[0-9][0-9] Version: .+ Reason: .+ Substitute: .+".  Note that it is still 
possible for some invalid dates in the "AsOf:" section to match this 
regular expression (such as "AsOf: 18/36/1099"), but using this regular 
expression will detect most invalid dates.

BENEFITS

<PRE>

If you deprecate code, it is a good idea to document when and why 
this was done as well as what the replacement for the deprecated
code is.

Make sure the '@deprecated' tag has a value which contains the 
labels "AsOf:", "Version:", "Reason:", and "Substitute:" (matching
spelling and capitalization exactly) and that these labels appear
in the specified order.  Make sure that the value of the '@deprecated'
tag matches the regular expression "AsOf: [0-1]?[0-9]/[0-3]?[0-9]/
[1-2][90][0-9][0-9] Version: .+ Reason: .+ Substitute: .+".

package examples.rules.codsta;

public class RFDTFixed {
    /** 
     * meth.
     *
