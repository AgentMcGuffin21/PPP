Component Coupling

Now that we've figured out how we should package
the various components of the Library, we discover
that there many dependencies between the jars
that we've created.

Exercise:

Restructure the code so that there are NO dependency
cycles between components and so that reusable components
do not depend upon application details.

Use the Component Coupling Principles.

NOTE: this will require more than simply moving files around.
