The Law (Suggestion) of Demeter

An object should only talk to its immediate neighbors. It should
not reach through its neighbor to the neighbor's neighbor. Doing
so binds the two distant objects and makes them both difficult to
change.

Exercise:

1. Get the failing test to pass.

2. Consider what you had to do to get it to pass. Did you notice
   any LoD violations? If so, refactor the code to eliminate them.
