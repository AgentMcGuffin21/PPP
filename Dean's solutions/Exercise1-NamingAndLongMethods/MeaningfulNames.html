  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>Maintenance errors occur when a programmer does not correctly
  understand the code he must modify. The diligent programmer may
  expend considerable effort to accurately decipher the true intent
  of a program, even though its purpose was obvious to the original
  author. Indeed, it takes much more time to determine how to
  change the code than to make and test the change.</p>

  <p>Some efforts to improve maintainability of code have actually
  exacerbated the problem by making names less intuitive, less
  obvious, and less natural. They make it easier to glean the
  information that <em>was not</em> lost (like type information and
  scope, still present in variable declarations), without making it
  easier to discover the more important information that
  <em>was</em> lost.</p>

  <p>Source code is a form of expression and so
  quality-of-expression must be a primary concern. Poor
  quality-of-expression creates ongoing costs and impacts the
  productivity (hence the reputation) of the team that produces it.
  Therefore software authors must learn to clearly express the
  intention of variables, methods, classes, and modules.</p>

  <p>An expressive name for a software object must be clear,
  precise, and small. This is a guide to better clarity, precision,
  and terseness in naming. It is the author's hope that you will
  find it useful.</p>

  <h3><a href="#TOC_Intentional" name="Intentional" id=
  "Intentional">Use Intention-revealing Names</a></h3>

  <p>We often see comments used where better naming would be
  appropriate:</p>
  <pre class="code">
                int d; // elapsed time in days
  
</pre>Such a comment is an excuse for not using a better variable
name. The name 'd' doesn't evoke a sense of time, nor does the
comment describe what time interval it represents. It requires a
change:
  <pre class="code">
                int elapsedTimeInDays;
                int daysSinceCreation;
                int daysSinceModification;
                int fileAgeInDays;
  
</pre>

  <p>The simple act of using a better name instead of applying a
  better comment can reduce the difficulty of working with the code
  we write.</p>

  <p>What is the purpose of this python code?</p>
  <pre class="code">
                list1 = []
                for x in theList:
                        if x[0] == 4: 
                                list1 += x;
                return list1
  
</pre>Why is it hard to tell what this code is doing? Clearly there
are no complex expressions. Spacing and indentation are reasonable.
There are only three variables and two constants mentioned at all.
There aren't even any fancy classes or overloaded operators, just a
list of lists (or so it seems).

  <p>The problem isn't the simplicity of the code but the
  <em>implicity</em> of the code (to coin a phrase): the degree to
  which the context is not explicit in the code itself. The code
  requires me to answer questions such as:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>What kinds of things are in <code>theList</code>?</li>

    <li>What is the significance of the zeroeth subscript of an
    item in <code>theList</code>?</li>

    <li>What is the significance of the value <code>4</code>?</li>

    <li>How would I use the list being returned?</li>
  </ol>This information is not present in the code sample, but it
  could have been. Say that we're working in a mine sweeper game.
  We find that the board is a list of cells called
  <code>theList</code>. Let's rename that to <code>theBoard</code>.

  <p>Each cell on the board is represented by a simple array. We
  further find that the zeroeth subscript is the location of a
  status value, and that a status value of 4 means 'flagged'. Just
  by giving these concepts names we can improve the code
  considerably:</p>
  <pre class="code">
                flaggedCells = []
                for cell in theBoard:
                        if cell[STATUS_VALUE] == FLAGGED:
                                flaggedCells += cell
                return flaggedCells   
  
</pre>Notice that the simplicity of the code is not changed. It
still has exactly the same number of operators and constants, with
exactly the same number of nesting levels.

  <p>We can go further and write a simple class for cells instead
  of using an array of ints. It can include an intention-revealing
  function (call it <code>isFlagged</code>) to hide the magic
  numbers. It results in a new version of the function:</p>
  <pre class="code">
                flaggedCells = []
                for cell in theBoard:
                        if cell.isFlagged():
                                flaggedCells += cell
                return flaggedCells
  
</pre>or more tersely:
  <pre class="code">
                return [ cell for cell in theBoard if cell.isFlagged() ] 
  
</pre>Even with the function collapsed to a list comprehension,
it's not difficult to understand. This is the power of naming.

  <h3><a href="#TOC_Avoid_Disinfo" name="Avoid_Disinfo" id=
  "Avoid_Disinfo">Avoid Disinformation</a></h3>

  <p>A software author must avoid leaving false clues which obscure
  the meaning of code.</p>

  <p>We should avoid words whose entrenched meanings vary from our
  intended meaning. For example, "<tt>hp</tt>", "<tt>aix</tt>", and
  "<tt>sco</tt>" would be poor variable names because they are the
  names of Unix platforms or variants. Even if you are coding a
  hypotenuse and "<tt>hp</tt>" looks like a good abbreviation, it
  is disinformative.</p>

  <p>Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an
  <tt>AccountList</tt> unless it's actually a <code>list</code>.
  The word <code>list</code> means something specific to CS people.
  If the container holding the accounts is not actually a list, it
  may lead to false conclusions. <tt>AccountGroup</tt> or
  <tt>BunchOfAccounts</tt> would have been better.</p>

  <p>Beware of using names which vary in small ways. How long does
  it take to spot the subtle difference between a
  <code>XYZControllerForEfficientHandlingOfStrings</code> in one
  module and, somewhere a little more distant
  <code>XYZControllerForEfficientStorageOfStrings</code>? The words
  have frightfully similar shape.</p>

  <p>With modern Java environments, you have automatic code
  completion. You will write a few characters of a name and press
  some hotkey combination (if that) and you will be greeted with a
  list of possible completions for that name. It is nice if names
  for very similar things sort together alphabetically, and if the
  differences are very, very obvious since the developer is likely
  to pick an object by name without seeing your copious comments or
  even the list of methods supplied by that class.</p>

  <p>A truly awful example of disinformative names would be the use
  of lower-case L or uppercase o as variable names, especially in
  combination. The problem, of course is that they look almost
  entirely like the constants one and zero (repectively).</p>
  <pre class="code">
    int a = l;
    if ( O = l )
        a = O1;
    else
        l = 01;
</pre>

  <p>The reader may think this a contrivance, but the author has
  examined code where such things were abundant. It's a great
  technique for shrouding code. The author of the code suggested
  using a different font so that the differences were more obvious,
  a solution that would have to be passed down to all future
  developers as oral tradition or in a written document. The
  problem is conquered with finality and without creating new work
  products if an author performs a simple renaming.</p>

  <h3><a href="#TOC_Disambig" name="Disambig" id="Disambig">Make
  Meaningful Distinctions</a></h3>

  <p>A problem arises from writing code solely to satisfy a
  compiler or interpreter. One can't have the same name referring
  to two things in the same scope, so one name is changed them in
  an arbitrary way. Sometimes this is done by misspelling one,
  leading to the surprising situation where correcting spelling
  errors leads to an inability to compile.</p>

  <p>It is not sufficient to add number series or noise words, even
  though the compiler is satisfied. If names must be different,
  then they should also mean something different.</p>

  <p>Number-series naming (a1, a2, .. aN) is the opposite of
  intentional naming. Without being disinformative, number series
  names provide no clue to the intention of the author. Naming by
  intention and by domain may lend one to use names like
  <code>lvalue</code> and <code>rvalue</code> or
  <code>source</code> and <code>destination</code> rather than
  <code>string1</code> and <code>string2</code>.</p>

  <p>Noise words are another meaningless distinction. Imagine that
  you have a <tt>Product</tt> class. If you have another called
  <tt>ProductInfo</tt> or <tt>ProductData</tt>, you have made the
  names different without making them mean anything different.
  <tt>Info</tt> and <tt>Data</tt> are indistinct noise words like
  "a", "an" and "the".</p>

  <p>Noise words are redundant. The word <tt>variable</tt> should
  never appear in a variable name. The word <tt>table</tt> should
  never appear in a table name. How is <tt>NameString</tt> better
  than <tt>Name</tt>? Would a <tt>Name</tt> ever be a floating
  point number? If so, it breaks an <a href=
  "#Avoid_Disinfo">earlier rule about disinformation</a>. Imagine
  finding one class named Customer and another named
  CustomerObject, what should you understand as the distinction?
  Which one will represent the best path to a customer's payment
  history?</p>

  <p>There is an application I know of where this is illustrated.
  I've changed the names to protect the guilty, but the exact form
  of the error is:</p>
  <pre class="code">
        getSomething();
        getSomethings();
        getSomethingInfo();
</pre>

  <p>Consider context. In the absence of a class named
  Denomination, <tt>MoneyAmount</tt> is no better than
  <tt>money</tt>. <tt>CustomerInfo</tt> is no better than
  <tt>Customer</tt>.</p>

  <p>Disambiguate in such a way that the reader knows what the
  different versions offer her, instead of merely that they're
  different.</p>

  <h3><a href="#TOC_Pronounceable" name="Pronounceable" id=
  "Pronounceable">Use Pronounceable Names</a></h3>

  <p>If you can't pronounce it, you can't discuss it without
  sounding like an idiot. <i>"Well, over here on the bee cee arr
  three cee enn tee we have a pee ess zee kyew int, see?"</i> This
  matters because programming is a social activity.</p>

  <p>A company I know has <tt>genymdhms</tt> (generation date,
  year, month, day, hour, minute and second) so they walked around
  saying <i>"gen why emm dee aich emm ess"</i>. I have an annoying
  habit of pronouncing everything as-written, so I started saying
  <i>"gen-yah-mudda-hims"</i>. It later was being called this by a
  host of designers and analysts, and we still sounded silly. But
  we were in on the joke, so it was fun. Fun or not, we were
  tolerating poor naming. New developers had to have the variables
  explained to them, and then they spoke about it in silly made-up
  words instead of using proper English terms.</p>

  <table width="80%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <pre class="code">
class DtaRcrd102 {
        private Date genymdhms; 
        private Date modymdhms;
        private final String pszqint = "102";
        /* ... */
};
  
</pre>
      </td>

      <td>
        <pre class="code">
class Customer {
        private Date generationTimestamp; 
        private Date modificationTimestamp;;
        private final String recordId = "102";
        /* ... */
};
  
</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Intelligent conversation is now possible:<i>"Hey, Mikey, take
  a look at this record! The generation timestamp is set to
  tomorrow's date! How can that be?"</i></p>

  <h3><a href="#TOC_Searchable" name="Searchable" id=
  "Searchable">Use Searchable Names</a></h3>

  <p>Single-letter names and numeric constants have a particular
  problem in that they are not easy to locate across a body of
  text.</p>

  <p>One might easily <tt>grep</tt> for MAX_CLASSES_PER_STUDENT but
  the number 7 could be more troublesome. Searches may turn up the
  digit as part of file names, other constant definitions, and in
  various expressions where the value is used with different
  intent. It is even worse when a constant is a long number and
  someone might have transposed digits, thereby creating a bug
  while simultaneously evading the programmer's search.</p>

  <p>Likewise, the name <tt>e</tt> is a poor choice for any
  variable for which a programmer might need to search. It is the
  most common letter in the English language, and likely to show up
  in every passage of text in every program. In this regard, longer
  names trump shorter names, and any searchable name trumps a
  constant in code.</p>

  <p>My personal preference is that single-letter names can ONLY be
  used as <b>local</b> variables inside <b>short</b> methods. The
  length of a name should somehow correspond to the size of its
  scope. If a variable or constant might be seen or used in
  multiple places in a body of code it is imperative to give it a
  search-friendly name.</p>

  <p>This rule is less important if the entire team always uses an
  intelligent IDE that can show you all instances of a given
  variable without doing a text search, but you will find that even
  such projects often resort to less elegant search solutions,
  especially when combating strange build errors.</p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <pre class="code">
        for (int j=0; j&lt;34; j++) {
                s += (t[j]*4)/5;
        }
  
</pre>
      </td>

      <td>
        <pre class="code">
        int realDaysPerIdealDay = 4;
        const int WORK_DAYS_PER_WEEK = 5;
        /*...*/
        for (int j=0; j &lt; NUMBER_OF_TASKS; j++) {
                int realTaskDays = taskEstimate[j] * realDaysPerIdealDay;
                int realTaskWeeks = (realdays / WORK_DAYS_PER_WEEK);
                sum+= realTaskWeeks;
        }
  
</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Note that "sum", above, is not a particularly useful name, but
  at least is searchable. The intentionally-named code makes for a
  longer function, but consider how much easier it will be to find
  WORK_DAYS_PER_WEEK than to find all the places where 5 was used,
  and filter the list down to just the instances with the intended
  meaning.</p>

  <h3><a href="#TOC_Avoid_Encodings" name="Avoid_Encodings" id=
  "Avoid_Encodings">Avoid Encodings</a></h3>

  <p>Encoded names require deciphering. It hardly seems reasonable
  to require each new employee to learn an encoding "language" in
  addition to learning the (usually considerable) body of code that
  they'll be working in. It is an unnecessary mental burden when
  trying to solve a problem. Encoded names are seldom <a href=
  "#Pronounceable">pronounceable</a> and are easy to mistype.</p>

  <p>In days of old, when you worked in name-length-challenged
  languages, you probably violated this rule with impunity and
  regret. Fortran forced it by basing type on the first letter,
  making the first letter a code for the type. Early versions of
  BASIC allowed only a letter plus one digit. Hungarian Notation
  (HN) has taken this to a whole new level</p>

  <p>HN was considered to be pretty important back in the Windows C
  API, when everything was an integer handle or a long pointer or a
  void pointer, or one of several implementations of "string" (with
  different uses and attributes). In <em>modern</em> languages we
  have much richer type systems. There is a trend toward smaller
  classes and shorter functions so that one can always see the
  point of declaration of each variable they're using.</p>

  <p>Modern languages don't need type encoding. Objects are
  strongly (and often dynamically) typed, and editing environments
  have advanced. You may feel naked without type encoding, but with
  "duck typing" your type-encoded variable names will usually be
  wrong anyway. You don't need it, can't do it reliably, and can
  learn to live without it.</p>

  <p>You don't need to prefix member variables with "m_"
  anymore.</p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <pre class="code">
  class { 
     String m_psz; // The textual description
     void setName(String psz) {
        m_psz = psz;
     }
  }
  
</pre>
      </td>

      <td>
        <pre class="code">
  class { 
     String description;
     void setName(String description) { 
        this.description = description;
     }
  }
  
</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>The other problem with prefix encoding is that people quickly
  learn to look past the prefix (or stop short of the suffix) to
  the meaningful part of the name. Those carefully crafted name
  systems end up being ignored (almost) totally. Eventually the
  prefixes are left unmaintained just as comments are left
  unmaintained.</p>
  <pre class="code">
  std::wstring pszName = L"hello"; // name not changed when type changed!
  
</pre>

  <h3><a href="#TOC_Mental_Map" name="Mental_Map" id=
  "Mental_Map">Avoid Mental Mapping</a></h3>

  <p>Readers shouldn't have to mentally translate your names into
  other names they already know. This problem generally arises from
  a choice to use neither <a href="#Problem_Domain">problem domain
  terms</a> nor <a href="#Solution_Domain">solution domain
  terms.</a></p>

  <p>This is a problem with single-letter variable names. Certainly
  a loop counter may be named <code>i</code> or <code>j</code> or
  <code>k</code> (though never <code>l</code>!) if its scope is
  very, very small and no other names can conflict with it. These
  are allowable because those are traditional solution-domain
  names. But generally, a single letter name <i>stands for</i>
  something else, or else has no meaning at all. There can be no
  worse reason for using the name <code>'c'</code> than <i>because
  <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> were already taken</i>.</p>

  <p>This has been a a problem with really smart programmers who
  can manipulate more than the standard 7-plus-or-minus-two symbols
  easily in their heads. They map so easily among twelve or fifteen
  arbitrarily-named objects that they can't image anything easier
  than the simple fact that r is the lower-cased version of the url
  with the host and scheme removed.</p>

  <p>Smart is overrated. Clarity is king. The very smart must use
  their talent to write code that others are less likely to
  misunderstand.</p>

  <h3><a href="#TOC_Nouns_Verbs" name="Nouns_Verbs" id=
  "Nouns_Verbs">Use Noun and Verb Phrases</a></h3>

  <p>Classes and objects should have noun or noun phrase names.</p>

  <p>There are some methods (commonly called
  <dfn>"accessors"</dfn>) which calculate and/or return a value.
  These reasonably may have noun names. This way accessing a
  person's first name can read as follows:</p>
  <pre class="code">
        string x = person.name();
   
</pre>because it is as obvious as:
  <pre class="code">
        string wholeName = person.getName();
        
</pre>

  <p>Other methods (sometimes called <dfn>"mutators"</dfn>, though
  not so commonly anymore) cause something to happen. These
  represent a small "transaction" on the object (and generally
  should be a complete action). Mutators should have verb or
  verb-phrase names. This way, changing a name would read:</p>
  <pre class="code">
        fred.changeNameTo("mike")
</pre>

  <p>You will notice that the above line reads more like a sentence
  than a lot of code. It leaves a dangling "to", which is completed
  by the parameter. The intention is to make the parameter list
  more obvious so that it is harder to make foolish errors.</p>

  <p>Another trend is to use a named creation function, rather than
  yet another overloaded constructor. It can be more obvious to
  read the creation of a complex number using</p>
  <pre class="code">
    Complex.FromRealNumber(23.0);
  
</pre>than using the constructor version
  <pre class="code">
    new Complex(23.0);
</pre>

  <p>As a class designer, does this sound boringly unimportant? If
  so, then go write code that uses your classes. The best way to
  test an interface is to use it and look for ugly, contrived, or
  confusing text. The most popular way to do this in the 21st
  century is to write <i>Unit Tests</i> for the module. If you have
  trouble reading the tests (or your partners do) then rework is in
  order.</p>

  <p>Over time we've found that this rule extends even to
  constructors. Rather than having a lot of overloaded constructors
  and having to chose among them by their parameter lists, we
  frequently create named creation functions as class (static)
  methods.</p>

  <h3><a href="#TOC_Too_Cute" name="Too_Cute" id="Too_Cute">Don't
  Be Cute</a></h3>

  <p>If names are too clever, they will be memorable only to people
  who share the author's sense of humor, and only as long as they
  remember the joke. Will the people know what the function named
  <code>HolyHandGrenade</code> is supposed to do? Sure, it's cute,
  but maybe in this case <code>DeleteItems</code> might be a better
  name. Save the comedy for comments, where busy people don't have

  <h3><a href="#TOC_Pick_One" name="Pick_One" id="Pick_One">Pick
  One Word Per Concept</a></h3>

  <p>Pick one word for one abstract function and stick with it. I
  hear that the Eiffel libraries excel at this, and I know that the
  C++ STL is very consistent. Sometimes the names seem a little odd
  (like <tt>pop_front</tt> for a list), but being consistent will
  reduce the overall learning curve for the whole library.</p>

  <p>For instance, it's confusing to have <tt>fetch</tt>,
  <tt>retrieve</tt> and <tt>get</tt> as equivalent methods of the
  different classes. How do you remember which method name goes
  with which class? Sadly, you often have to remember which
  company, group, or individual wrote the library or class in order
  to remember which term was used. Otherwise, you spend an awful
  lot of time browsing through headers and previous code
  samples.</p>

  <p>It's not as bad as it used to be. Modern editing environments
  like Eclipse, IntelliJ, Eric, and the like will provide hints to
  you. You type the name of an object and a dot, and up pops a list
  of methods you can call. But note that the list doesn't give you
  the comments you wrote around your function names and parameter
  lists. You are lucky if it gives the parameter names from
  function declarations. The function names have to stand alone,
  and they have to be consistent in order for you to pick the
  correct method without any additional exploration.</p>

  <p>Likewise, it's confusing to have a <tt>controller</tt> and a
  <tt>manager</tt> and a <tt>driver</tt> in the same process. What
  is the essential difference between a DeviceManager and a
  ProtocolController? Why are both not controllers, or both not
  managers? Are they both Drivers, really? The name leads you to
  expect two objects that have very different <i>type</i> as well
  as having different <i>classes.</i></p>

  <p>A consistent lexicon is a great boon to programmers who must
  use your classes, even if it may seem like a pain while
  developing the classes. If you have to, you can write it into a
  wiki page or a document, but then it must be maintained. Don't
  create documents lightly.</p>

  <h3><a href="#TOC_Mult_Meanings" name="Mult_Meanings" id=
  "Mult_Meanings">Don't Pun</a></h3>

  <p>Try to never use the same word for two purposes.</p>

  <p>After implementing the previous rule, you may have many
  classes with an <code>add</code> method. As long as the parameter
  lists are semantically equal and the desired result is the same,
  all is well.</p>

  <p>However one might decide to use the word <code>add</code> for
  "consistency" when they are not in fact <i>adding</i> in the same
  sense. Perhaps in many classes "add" will create a new value by
  adding or concatenating two existing value. It might seem
  consistent to call your new method <code>add</code> even though
  it really only puts its single parameter into a collection. In
  this case, the semantics are different, and so there should be
  two different words used (perhaps <code>add</code> and either
  <code>insert</code> or <code>append</code>). Using the same term
  for two different ideas is essentially a <em>pun</em>.</p>

  <p>However surprising it may seem to say so, you want your
  readers to afford some lazy reading and assumptions. You want
  your code to be a quick skim, not an intense study. You want to
  use the popular paperback model whereby the author is responsible
  for making himself clear and not the academic model where it is
  the scholar's job to dig the meaning out of the paper.</p>

  <p>Again, you may need to write up an official project glossary
  if you start to have problems keeping the set of names and
  concepts clear. You might need to consider using more <a href=
  "#Disambig">meaningful distinctions</a>.</p>

  <h3><a href="#TOC_Solution_Domain" name="Solution_Domain" id=
  "Solution_Domain">Use Solution Domain Names</a></h3>

  <p>Go ahead, use computer science (CS) terms, algorithm names,
  pattern names, math terms, etc.</p>

  <p>It may seem a heretical notion, but you don't want your
  developers having to run back and forth to the customer asking
  what every name means <b><i>if</i></b> they already know the
  concept by a different name.</p>

  <p>We're talking about code here, so you're more likely to have
  your code maintained by a CS major or informed programmer than by
  a domain expert with no programming background. End users of a
  system very seldom read the code, but the maintainers have
  to.</p>

  <h3><a href="#TOC_Problem_Domain" name="Problem_Domain" id=
  "Problem_Domain">Use Problem Domain Names</a></h3>

  <p>When there is no `programmer-ese' for what you're doing, use
  the name from the problem domain. At least the programmer who
  maintains your code <b>can</b> ask his boss what it means.</p>

  <p>In analysis, of course, this is the superior rule to&nbsp;
  <a href="#Solution_Domain">[Use Solution Domain Names]</a>,
  because the end-user is the target audience.</p>

  <h3><a href="#TOC_In_Context" name="In_Context" id=
  "In_Context">Add Meaningful Context</a></h3>

  <p>There are few names which are meaningful in and of themselves.
  Most, however are not. Instead, you need to place names in
  context for your reader by enclosing them in well-named classes,
  functions, or namespaces. When all else fails, then prefixing the
  name may be necessary as a last resort.</p>

  <p>If you have a number of variables with the same prefix
  (address_firstName, address_lastname, address_Street), it can be
  a pretty clear clue that you need to create a class for them to
  live in. As a short-term measure and a means to an end, prefixing
  might not be intolerable. After all, every road out of Rome is
  also a road into Rome.</p>

  <p>The term `<dfn>tree</dfn>' needs some disambiguation if it
  appears in a forestry application. You may have syntax trees,
  red-black or b-trees, and also elms, oaks, and pines. The word
  `tree' is a good word, and is not to be avoided, but it must be
  placed in context every place it is used.</p>

  <p>If you review a program or enter into a conversation where the
  word "tree" could mean either, and you aren't sure, then the
  author (speaker) will have to clarify. Sadly, source won't
  explain itself to us, so it must be made clear.</p>

  <h3><a href="#TOC_Artificial_Context" name="Artificial_Context"
  id="Artificial_Context">Don't add Gratuitous Context</a></h3>

  <p>In an imaginary application called "Gas Station Deluxe", it is
  a bad idea to prefix every class with `<tt>GSD</tt>'. Frankly,
  you are working against your tools. You type G and press the
  completion key, and are rewarded with a mile-long list of
  <i>every class in the system</i>. Is that wise? Why make it hard
  for the IDE to help you? Otherwise, the regular developer will
  have to learn to ignore the GSD at the front.</p>

  <p>Likewise, say you invented a `Mailing Address' class in
  <tt>GSD</tt>'s accounting module, and you named it
  <tt>GSDAccountAddress</tt>. Later, you need a mailing address for
  your customer contact application. Do you use
  `<tt>GSDAccountAddress</tt>'? Does it sound like the right name?
  10 of 17 characters are redundant or irrelevant</p>

  <p>Shorter names are generally better than longer ones, if they
  are clear. Add no more context to a name than is necessary.</p>

  <p>The names `<tt>accountAddress</tt>' and
  `<tt>customerAddress</tt>' are fine names for instances of the
  class Address but could be poor names for classes. Address is a
  fine name for a class. If I need to differentiate between MAC
  addresses, port addresses, and web addresses, I might consider
  PostalAddress, MAC, and URI. The resulting names are <i>more</i>
  precise, and isn't precision the point of all naming?</p>

  <h3><a name="Final_Words" id="Final_Words"></a>Final Words
  ...</h3>

  <p>The hardest thing about choosing good names is that it
  requires good descriptive skills and a shared cultural
  background. This is a teaching issue, rather than a technical,
  business, or management issue. As a result many people in this
  field don't do it very well.</p>

  <p>People are also afraid of renaming things, for fear that some
  other developers will object. I have been working with people who
  do not share that fear, and I find that I am actually grateful
  when names change (for the better). Most of the time, I don't
  really memorize the names of classes and methods like I thought I
  did. I use the modern tools to deal with details like that, and I
  focus on whether my code reads like paragraphs and sentences, or
  at least like tables and data structure (a sentence isn't always
  the best way to display data). You will probably end up
  surprising someone when you rename, just like you might with any
  other code <i>improvement</i>, don't let it stop you in your
  tracks.</p>

  <p>Follow some of these rules, and see if you don't improve the
  readability of your code. If you are maintaining someone else's
  code, use refactoring tools to help resolve these problems. It
  will pay off in the short term, and continue to pay in the long
  run.</p>

  <h3>Notes</h3>

  <p>This paper grew out of some postings made on usenet,
  specifically <a href="news:comp.object">comp.object</a>, in 1997.
  There was some response, which was incorporated from its many
  sources, and it is presented here in entirety, enhanced a bit.
  Thanks to all involved.</p>

  <p>Brad Appleton took the time to convert the original textual
  version to hypertext, and I thank him for the this
  encouragement.</p>

  <p>Thanks to all my friends at Object Mentor for encouraging
  updates to the rules.</p>
