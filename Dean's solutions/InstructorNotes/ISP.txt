Remind people of the Extract Interface refactoring

Extract Interfaces for each type of media on
MediaGateway:
- BookGateway
- CompactDiscGateway
- etc

one possible outcome is:

public class RealMediaGateway implements BookGateway, CompactDiscGateway, etc

another possible outcome is:

public interface MediaGateway
public interface BookGateway extends MediaGateway
public interface CompactDiscGateway extends MediaGateway

Discuss when using the adapter might be appropriate.

Additional constraints for the advanced (faster) students
 The MediaGateway owners won't let them modify
 the interace.  (Adpaters are needed for this solution)
