Tomcat README

Exercises 3 and later and the final "Library" project can 
be run in a web server. These instructions are for Tomcat.
See websphere_usage.txt for Websphere...

Running Tomcat:

1) Install Tomcat v4 (JDK 1.4) or v5 (JDK v1.5) from tomcat.apache.org.
2) Define CATALINA_HOME to point to the installation directory 
(unless already defined).
3) In a separate shell window, cd to $CATALINA_HOME/bin 
(or %CATALINA_HOME\bin for Windows).
4) Run the command:
	startup.sh    # Unix
or
  startup.bat		# Windoze

Install Application:

1) For any of the exercises or the "Library" project, make sure
the tests pass in Eclipse first.
2) In another shell, run ant to build and deploy the application:
	ant all

The first time you run this command, the build will fail while running
the "remove" target. This is because your application is not yet installed
in Tomcat. For this first-time installation, run the command:
	ant install
	
All subsequent "ant all" builds should work.

Surf to the "Library"!

1) http://localhost:8080/Library

This is the URL for the exercises, too. Note that if you have set up 
Tomcat to use a different port, you'll have to adjust the URL
accordingly.
