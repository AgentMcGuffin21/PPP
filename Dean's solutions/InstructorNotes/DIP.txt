* The current implementations are concrete fakes. We should see an interface
	appear for each gateway/service with both concrete and mock implementations.

* Record the test time
	
* White board a design improvement
  * IsbnService -> interface
    * IsbnServiceImplementation
    * Mock
  * MediaGateway -> interface
    * Existing becomes Fake/Mock implementation
  * Ditto on the PatronGateway


Discuss after students complete the exercise
* Interfaces in ...gateways
* Fake/Mock implementations in ...mocks
* The test-specific code should end up in the mocks with no comments necessary.
* What are the implications of test-specific methods in the mocks on the 
  tests	themselves:
		- declare as MockBlah?
		- downcast?
	- compare Application class with wiring in tests
* Note the decrease in test time
