Notes on the Web Architecture for "Library" and the Exercises

For maximum portability, the only Web-tier toolkits used are
the Servlet and JSP APIs. Extensions like Struts and JSF were
not used. Similarly, alternative frameworks like Tapestry were
not used.

However, the implementation borrows common patterns, like
"Front Controller", which are usually implemented by toolkits
like Struts. Similarly, Ruby on Rails concepts like "convention
over configuration" were used. For example, form post URIs are
mapped to corresponding Java packages, classes, and methods
using a naming convention.

Some design choices were made to simplify the structure for
teaching purposes. For example, security issues, which would be
important for a publically-accessible application, were ignored.

As much as possible, business logic is in the "application" 
packages. The web-related packages and JSP pages are kept as
simple as possible. Among the many advantages, this strategy
promotes easier testing.
