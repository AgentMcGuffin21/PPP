* Note the switches on media type in Library and DamagedCondition.
  (This code is similar to, but not identical to the corresponding 
  code in the DIP exercise. These 	two exercises used to come in 
  the opposite order, and the DIP's code handled media types 
  "better". This code was "defactored" when the exercise order was
	reversed.)

* Emphasize refactoring first (README says so, but not everybody reads).

* Expected outcome:
  - Separate classes for Media types: Media (abstract), Book, CD, 
    Periodical (extra credit)
  - should include getCharge, calculateFine, dueDate
	- they should have resolved switch in DamagedCondition. They likely did so
		by adding getDamageCharge() to media. Hint at the LSP violation (without
		mentioning LSP).
