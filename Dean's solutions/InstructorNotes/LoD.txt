Patron gateway should not be returning Lists and Maps and nextIDs.

The source of the bug is that Patron.getId() is returning 
the same ID for all patrons.

To get the test to pass, setting the id's of ALL patrons wil result
a passing test.  Not setting al patrons results in 
NullPointerExceptions.

Whose responsibility is the assignment of the ID?  Right now 
the client is responsible by default.  The Gateway should
take responsibility.

This is a very baby-step intensive surgery - emphasize that the
tests must be run between each step.

Look for use of setId() to see all the places that call it.  Removing 
these LoD violations results in more responsible code.

Discussion:

A side effect of removing LoD violations may be a lowered LOC count.
