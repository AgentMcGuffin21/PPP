Bug/LSP Violation: HardCover/SoftCover is defined in Media. 
CDs always report themselves as SoftCover.  This is hard to discover.

Suggest that students try to add a test that causes the failure.
They should eventually add this to some test (like 
testReportWithManyOfBoth) and see it fail
		MediaCopy cd = gateway.addCopy(new CompactDisc("a", "b", "c"));
    cd.setLoaned(new LoanReceipt(null));

After they are stuck for a while give them a hint. Suggest
they put some other media into the system and see if that impacts 
the report. (CDs should not impact this report)

Fix should be to push format and format type down to book and let the
report check instanceof (against media) OR add method to gateway
to get BOOKS (not media).

Introduction of Video Cassette type might expose LSP problem if getRewindCharge
is calculated in media (even if the method is declared abstract in media).
Discuss.
