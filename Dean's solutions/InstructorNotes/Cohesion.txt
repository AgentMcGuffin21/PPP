Help the students recognize the emergence of a web framework and that the framework
should be a separate component (or series of components) from the application (domain
logic).

The following should all be separate:
Model
Controllers
Services
Gateway
Utilities
Framework

NOTE - The Coupling build.xml file could serve as a guide for YOU (teacher).

NOTE - If useful, have the students view the "jdepend_report.png" file to see the 
current package dependencies. However, this is really intended for exercise 9,
on coupling.
