The code in this exercise is full of long methods, ugly names,
and ugly comments.

 * Catalog has strange names like find2, findList, etc.
   It also has lots of empty Javadoc comments.
   * One solution is to fix the names and the comments
   * Another is to fix the names and delete the comments

 * CatalogTest is one giant test function that should be split up.
   * See SRP for the BookCatalogTest as a solution
    * note the name change, test partitioning, and documentation
      value of the tests

 * MockDataServices and it's interface DataServices also have short
   and inappropriate method and parameter names.

 * Library has version control comments as well as inappropriate 
   method and parameter names.
