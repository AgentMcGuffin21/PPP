Coupling Exercise

Look at exercise-9 jdepend report, "jdepend_report.png". (Hopefully, their computers
will either have an image viewer that supports PNG or a browser that does.) You may
consider printing copies to pass around beforehand. This image shows the current 
package dependencies. The raw data is in "jdepend_report.xml".  See the notes
"jdepend_usage.txt" for more information on how this data was generated.


Drive discussion to elimninate arrows going in the wrong direction.

Resulting structure should be as in PUS jdepend report.

Bob broke these deps by using template method (see Library Project)
