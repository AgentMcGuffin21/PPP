Here is a little help on how the OM web framework works.


Click on a page, note the url, for example
 * http://localhost:8080/Library/patrons/books/loanBook.do
 
Everything goes through ControllerServlet.java

doGet - gets a web page

doPost - puts form data and gets a reply page

controllerServelet.handle takes patrons/books/loanBook fromthe url
and makes a java package and class name.  The class name in this example
is com.objectmentor.library.web.controller.patrons.BooksController.
The method loadBook() in the controller will be invoked subsequently...

When loadBook() is done, the work for loadBook is done and the next 
page has been identified.

At the end of handle, the forward method is called to create the next web page.

The "forward(request, response)" call request parameter identifies the 
next page content..

Controller.java sets the template.jsp as the resource_path to be used for
all  (or almost all) library pages.
