JDepend Usage

The final Library project and Exercises 8 and 9 all contain "jdepend_report.png" images
and corresponding "*.xml" (raw data) and "*.dot" (input for the GraphViz "dot" program)
files used to create the image. All these files were generated using the "Library/jdepend.sh"
script. To regenerate them, run the following bash shell commands:

	in Library:		            ./jdepend.sh
	in Exercise8-Packaging:		../../Library/jdepend.sh
	in Exercise9-Coupling:		../../Library/jdepend.sh
	
Note that the script requires GraphViz to be installed, for the "dot" program,
xsltproc, to convert the output XML to the "dot" format, and of course JDepend. If any
of these is not available, an appropriate warning is printed.

I ran the script on Linux, but it should also work on OS X. I did notice one problem on Linux; 
at the end of the run, it attempts to open the PNG file using the "eog" image viewer. For some
reason, nothing happens. You can run the same command just fine in a bash shell. (The script
uses Preview on OS X...)

Older copies of the output files are moved to a "jdepend.bak" directory and a time stamp
is added to their names.

If you look at the Library/jdepend_report.png", you will notice there is one cyclic
dependency in the package graph.
